"I've always found programming extremely interesting and a little while ago I decided that I'd like to seriously go at it, specifically web development.

The problem that I have, is not knowing where to start. I've watched many web development videos on youtube and heard many different things, from picking up a certain language and practicing it, to picking up a framework like ""Ruby on Rails"" etc. The thing that worries me the most however, is that everything is new to me, when I see an abbreviation of something that keeps being mentioned(things like MVC, OOP, etc.) and I google it, I end up with 10 more new abbreviations and it keeps going.

So I was wondering, for a person who wants to get into building websites/web apps, where should I start? Or to make this little cry for help easier to answer:

    What do you think about a total beginner starting with Ruby on Rails?

    Should I read a book/blog/watch a video on computer science 101 before getting into anything specific?

    I'd also be more than happy if you could suggest any good reading/video material to check out concerning any of the questions above.

    My friend told me to learn how websites/servers work, learn about cookies, MySQL and preferably pick Laravel over Ruby on Rails(altho from what I've read it seems like Rails might be a more beginner friendly choice).

I understood that Front-End developer and Back-End developer have different duty simply like below.

Front-End developer : html css js
Back-End developer : Django Web framework in Server

Back-End developer(Server -> Data) 
Front-End Developer(Data->html with css,js(JQuery,Angular..))

I understood that Django framework is coupled with Front-End side. So I would like to send data by django rest framework to spearate duty more clearly(uncoupled way) for front-end and back-end developers.

I thought that if Front-end developer knows information of data**(like below)** which they will get for page(template) or send, They can build up page with html, css, js without any coupled works. 
but I am very confused.
To use serializer of django restframework, you also need to pass through Serializer -> View -> Renderer. it will conflict in views. One url and two views which is related to it...

You need to show template in django and need to send JSON data to template to show list of users in django restframework module. How can you do that?

How can front end developer and back end developer work without much coupled task in Django Framework?

"I started learning programming sometime ago and started with HTML & CSS, finally mastered both of them, now I started using Javascript and learning Javascript.

Translate to react native and finish coding the whole thing and have a working Web, iOS and Android app. (Haven't done this yet but this is my small understanding about how all this works)

Today I stumbled across Golang...

Loved how simple Golang looks and how easier it is to read than Javascript. I read the differences and similarities , also some tutorials. Now for you Golangers (Gophers?) I have multiple questions.

If I make my app in Golang how do I do the front end? Do I implement html and css? Do I do something else as a visual editor (like Adobe XD as a banal example) ? Do I use React to create the iOS,Android app? Can I use mongoDB(I assume yes as mongoldb was done on Golang, but I still rather ask)?

How does the typical steps in creating an application look like in go?

(Example as with Nodejs web app) 1.Create an Html and CSS UI 2.Add javascript for functionality of the app 3.run on node 4.import into React for iOS and Javascript 5.finish app and deploy

"I would like to enter a career as a BI Developer but concentrating on the front-end side of BI. My understanding is a back-end BI Developer focuses on integration and data-warehouses, whereas a front-end BI Developer focuses on the reporting sides of things. The front-end BI Developer will take data from data marts, model it, create the analytics and then produce the insights. The front-end BI Developer also has more stakeholder interaction.

I would like a career with plenty of opportunities so I feel working with Microsoft (MS) products is a good choice. My intention was to learn, and learn well, the following MS products: T-SQL SSRS Power Query DAX Power BI SSAS Tabular Power Pivot

However, I am struggling to master each product with the time I have available. Therefore I feel it a wise decision to concentrate on the 'under-the-hood' products which are the following: T-SQL Power Query DAX

To me SSRS, Power, Power Pivot, and SSAS Tabular are the tools, wizards if you like. I feel it will make someone a much stronger candidate if they actually knew how to write the low-level code rather than rely on the tool's wizard interface.

For those in the BI arena, and maybe who recruit for BI Professionals, do you feel what I've mentioned is a wise move or should I try to get strong at each product (this will be harder due to having to spread my efforts with the time I have)?

Notice how I haven't mentioned, till now, Excel. I understand it to be the world's foremost BI tool but as it's so widespread, and so many people can use it, I feel that I wouldn't be advancing my career progression by learning something that maybe isn't considered a particular skilset as most can dabble in it.

"I have been searching the web for this information and I think I need some help with understanding this better.

I would like to learn how to write back-end of a web application in C++ and essentially how to output C++ to web pages and make it talk to a MySQL database. For the record I can write decent code in C++ but I never did it for web.

Wherever I go on the web and find people asking about this the first list of responses is WHY would you when yo have scripting languages. I am aware of the scripting languages, I have used them for years but I am running across cases where this is a requirement and I would like to learn more about it.

My intent it to write an app that uses Angularjs on the front and C++ on the back. I am a fairly well versed PHP developer and I might take this task on by writing PHP initially but I do need to account for a possibility of rewriting in C++ and this makes me think I should probably write it in C++ from the get go.

I understand that the most usual question is WHY I would use C++ instead of a scripting language so I will try and give a limited set of reasons. Please do understand I am not a pro in this aspect of C++ yet and I am evaluating the situation I am in.

So here are some of my reasons...

    The project I am about to take on is bound to be very resource intensive and I would really like to gain all the speed I can possibly get from the get go. The more control I have over the app process the better. Essentially I need precision, I know and love C++ and it allows me to retain the control to a great degree..

    The group of people I am talking to in the context of the project are aware of the advantages of C++ fro the resources and speed perspective and they hold a portion of the investment bag which gives them a vote in how the project will be approached. Time IS on my side, but i want to waste as little of it as possible.

    I am comfortable with C++, have a C++ oriented mind and would love to use it in this context as much as possible.

So I guess my questions are...

    Is there a good tutorial that can take me from the basics to something intermediate?
    How do I write a web site backend in C++?
    How do I write C++ to work with MySQL on Linux.
    Is there a way to do this on Linux servers? (I believe Facebook it doing it).

I found this http://www.compileonline.com/compile_cpp_online.php on http://www.compileonline.com and it is giving me hope but I need more information to know how to get there.

"New to Django and even newer to ReactJS. I have been looking into AngularJS and ReactJS, but decided on ReactJS. It seemed like it was edging out AngularJS as far as popularity despite AngularJS having more of a market share, and ReactJS is said to be quicker to pickup.

All that junk aside, I started taking a course on Udemy and after a few videos it seemed important to see how well it integrates with Django. That is when I inevitably hit a wall just getting it up and running, what kind of documentation is out there so that I am not spinning my wheels for several hours and nights.

There really isn't any comprehensive tutorials, or pip packages, I came across. The few I came across didn't work or were dated, pyreact for example.

One thought I had was just to treat ReactJS completely separate, but keeping into consideration the classes and IDs I want the ReactJS components to render in. After the separate ReactJS components are compiled into a single ES5 file, just import that single file into the Django template.

I think that will quickly breakdown when I get to rendering from Django models although the Django Rest Framework sounds like it is involved. Not even far enough to see how Redux affects all of this.

Anyway, anyone have a clear way they are using Django and ReactJS they care to share?

At any rate, the documentation and tutorials are plentiful for AngularJS and Django, so it is tempting to just go that route to get started with any front-end framework... Not the best reason.

"I can't get my head around OOP in JavaScript.

Many years ago, I used to dabble in programming BASIC and learned a bit of COBOL and FORTRAN in school so I am somewhat familiar with procedural programming, but I never learned any of these to a very high level of proficiency or complexity. I've also done a few hackey things with JS but I guess it was mostly procedural in nature rather than OOP.

"I'm considering porting a speech 2D HTML5 web game I've built to Unity2D for iPhone and Android. I'm a full-stack web developer, and not a Unity developer, so an agency would help me build the Unity app. Before signing with them, I need to be sure both Speech to Text (STT) and Text to Speech (TTS) services are available for Mandarin, Spanish, and English, otherwise I'd waste a lot of money up front.

For Web, Webkit Speech (STT Docs, STT Demo, TTS Docs, TTS Demo) is easily accessible via the browser. I've found that IBM Watson has an API available, and has demos for STT and TTS, and I've found that they have a Unity SDK here, but I don't have the skillsets to test the Unity SDK.

I'm looking for guidance on great STT and TTS APIs that the agency can use for those three foreign languages.

    Does the Unity SDK provide support for frontend STT and TTS audio streaming? STT needs to capture users' voice input and transcribe it quickly. Likewise, TTS needs to allow the user to hover over a target language word and listen to a near-native pronunciation.
    Does it offer both STT and TTS for Spanish, Mandarin, and English?
    What other NLP APIs are there which meet my requirements?

Apologies, I'm completely new to Unity/phone development so any guidance here would be extremely helpful. If no APIs exist that meet these requirements then Unity won't work for my app since STT and TTS is critical.

"I am kind of confused about when an API is needed. I have recently created a mobile app with flutter and cloud firestore as the database where i simply queried and wrote to the database when needed. Now i am learning full stack web development and I recently watched a tutorial where he built like an Express API with GET, POST, and DELETE functionality for a simple item in the database.

Coming from a background where i just directly accessed the database i am not sure why an API in this case is necessary, is it so I wouldnt have to rewrite the queries every time? This is a very simple project so he's definitely not making a 3rd party api for other developers to use. Am i misunderstanding what an API does exactly?

It was really simple, there was one collection in a MongoDB database and he was using postman to read and write to and from the database to check if it works.

"I started learning Python working on projects involving data and following tutorials advising to install the anaconda bundle, to take advantage of the other libraries coming with it.

So did I and I got confortable with it, I liked the way it manages environments.

During the last months, I have been teaching myself web development with django, flask, continuing to use the anaconda python. But most of the time I install the dependencies I need with pip install though (inside the conda environment).

I've never seen any tutorials or podcasts mentioning the conda environment as an option for developing web apps so I start to get worried. Is it for a good reason?

Everywhere its the combination of pip and virtualenv that prevail. And virtualenv isn't compatible with anaconda that has its own env management system.

My newbie question is: Will I run into problems later (dependencies management in production or deployment maybe?) using the anaconda distribution to develop my web apps?

"i've been studying up on webpack for a couple of weeks now, and i've seen many examples of front end setups, and probably just this one setup for a backend.

i'm trying to setup a react app with a node back-end (e.g. express, koa, hapi, etc) where i would need at least one transpilation step for the back-end (e.g. babel, coffeescript, etc), and i think it would be nice to use webpack there for consistency vs adding another build mechanism to the mix (e.g. gulp, grunt, etc).

it would also be great if i could make changes to the backend and have the server restart automatically (watch style).

i'm wondering if the best way to do that is to basically have two distinct project setups with their own package.json and webpack.config files. maybe nest the back-end one under a server folder in the top level project folder, and use one or more script directives in the top level package.json file to control the two.

i guess i might have to proxy one server to the other to avoid CORS issues as well.

looking for any guidance from those more webpack battle tested than i for a decent setup.

regards, tony.

"I know it is a very much a beginner question but I am struggling to grasp a few things when it comes to the MERN stack and GraphQL. There is this particular project on github where the web app is developed using MongoDB, Express, React and Nodejs along with GraphQL.

I do understand that MongoDB is used for data storage and React for the front end but I can't wrap my head around as for why Express and Nodejs is used if an API is created with GraphQL which POSTs and GETs data directly to/from the MongoDB database? What is the role and interconnection between nodejs, express and graphql?

This question might not make sense to you because I am missing the knowledge of basic concepts of web app development and understanding of web dev stacks such as MERN.

Now my webapp is finished, and I want it to become public because I'd love my friends and family could see it.

"I'm wondering if there is some software that makes creating websites easier like a ""Photoshop"" with buttons and menus for front-end development. Or do people just code the whole thing in a text editor?

I'm asking because I came across a video about ""Webflow"" and it seems like building a website using tools like this would be much faster for professionals than coding it.

Do professionals use any tools like this? If so which are the most popular?

"I have been learning full stack web development for a while now. But I am having trouble to understand where would the job of back-end developer stops, and front end begins when the work is separated.

I understand the back-end developer builds API that the front end developer will interact with, but I am confused regarding routing and (using nodeJS) who would write the equivalent of what is in the app.js file.

Finally, If you do back-end only, then you would not write any 'views.ejs' files?",web developer,497,1,0,1,1,0,1
"Just a question to know how the recruiters think. I know the difference between the ""Front-end development"" and the ""Back-end Development"". In a recent application process, the recruiter said that my experience was in ""Software Development"" but lack of ""Back-end Development"".

For my understanding and techopedia, back-end development refer to everything that isn't front-end, like database and the logical part of the software/system/application, in an application online or desktop. I even think the Software development may include the front-end part.

Can you explicit say the difference between ""Software Development"" and ""Back-end Development""? With this I can work on my CV that I can let the recruiters know if I'm talking about software development or back-end development.",web developer,783,1,0,1,2,0,1

"So I'm not totally new to web development or anything...reasonably experienced with it actually, to an extent.

But I had only ever used window and document in the past, amongst what I have now learned are many DOM API interfaces.

This is unnerving to me. In my quest to become a truly capable web developer, the extent of the DOM API has so far been the scariest thing I have encountered. It seems very difficult to me to get a real, strong grasp on it.

So I'm wondering, to developers more experienced with this, how did you learn it? Are there any excellent resources in particular, or an order you went in? Which parts of it are important? Which parts could easily be ignored completely?

I mean, even just in document, there are many methods I am totally unfamiliar with.",web developer,778,1,0,1,2,0,1

"I'm a Web Developer and Backend Architect. As a Developer I need Web Hosting to run and deploy my code. Normal Web hosting plans don't offer flexibility, they're focused on simplicity and ease of use for normal/non-tech people. However, I need full stack hosting, a server where I have full control. Where I can install my necessary and preferred software, run my own programs like I do in my own PC. I have seen dedicated hosting, VPS hosting, cloud servers and I don't know which one actually fits my needs.I'll be happy if someone gives me some guidance.
